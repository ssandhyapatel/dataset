# dataData Visualization Project
This project visualizes various aspects of the dataset using Matplotlib. It includes plots for analyzing trends, distributions, and relationships between key variables.

Plots Included
Line Plot:
Visualizes Completed Trips over time.
Bar Plot:
Displays total Requests by hour of the day.
Scatter Plot:
Shows the relationship between Eyeballs and Completed Trips.
Histogram:
Represents the distribution of Unique Drivers.
Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date of recorded data in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Completed Trips: Total number of completed trips.
Time (Local): Hour of the day in local time (0â€“23).
Requests: Number of requests received during a given hour.
Eyeballs: Number of views or users engaging with the service.
Unique Drivers: Number of unique drivers available at that time.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Libraries:
matplotlib
pandas
Install the libraries using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib pandas
Usage
Ensure your dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame named df.
Columns in the dataset should match the names listed in the "Dataset Description" section.
Run the Python script to generate the visualizations.
Visualizations
1. Line Plot:
Purpose: Track trends in Completed Trips over time.
2. Bar Plot:
Purpose: Analyze the distribution of Requests by hour of the day.
3. Scatter Plot:
Purpose: Investigate the correlation between Eyeballs and Completed Trips.
4. Histogram:
Purpose: Understand the distribution of Unique Drivers.
Example Code

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset creation (replace with your data loading process)
data = {
    'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03', '2023-01-04'],
    'Completed Trips': [10, 15, 7, 20],
    'Time (Local)': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'Requests': [50, 30, 20, 10],
    'Eyeballs': [100, 200, 150, 300],
    'Unique Drivers': [5, 10, 15, 20]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
